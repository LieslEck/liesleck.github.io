    "text": "This map of Wisconsin shows the 7 senate districts from 2016 and they are shaded according to proportion of votes for each party in that district (red = republican, blue = democrat). When you click on each district you also get two articles of information, which district you are looking at, and the proportion of republican votes in that district. This is important information because it tells us how much more or less than 50% each district votes republican and gives us an idea of voting demographics and why the districts may be split like they are."

The Handwriting dataset comes from a survey where participants were asked to identify the gender of the author based on the handwriting presented. I chose to look at the relationship between gender of the participant and average performance (by gender) on the survey. I used a loop to simulate the null world by shuffling the data 1000 times and recording the difference of the average between genders after each one.\nThis graph shows the simulated null world distribution and has a vertical line marker that represents the real world observation. The p-value for this observation is 0. This means that women’s performance was statistically significantly higher than men’s performance on the survey."
